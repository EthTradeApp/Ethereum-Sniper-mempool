# Ethereum Sniper Mempool Bot

A high-performance mempool analysis tool designed for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, built to identify and execute trades during token launch liquidity events with sub-second precision. This bot combines real-time blockchain data monitoring with adaptive transaction routing to capitalize on early-stage market opportunities while integrating safeguards against common DeFi risks.  

## Core Capabilities  
The Ethereum Sniper Mempool operates as an automated trading assistant that scans pending transactions across multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. By analyzing mempool activity patterns, it detects newly added liquidity pools and token launches across major decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Pancakeswap. The system employs dynamic gas fee optimization to prioritize transaction inclusion during network congestion while maintaining configurable buy/sell thresholds.  

Key differentiators include a proprietary honeypot detection algorithm that evaluates contract bytecode for malicious patterns and a multi-chain compatibility layer supporting Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Fantom networks. The architecture leverages WebSocket connections to node providers for instantaneous event response, typically executing trades within 300-500ms of liquidity pool creation.  

## Strategic Advantages  
This solution addresses three critical challenges in decentralized trading: First-mover advantage through atomic transaction bundling that combines approval and swap operations. Risk mitigation via real-time tax rate analysis and liquidity pool health checks. Market adaptability through machine learning models that adjust trading parameters based on historical launch performance across different token standards.  

The bot's modular design allows for seamless integration of new decentralized exchange interfaces and blockchain networks. A unique feature is its Telegram-based alert system that provides human-readable transaction summaries while maintaining API-level response times. Security implementations include encrypted credential storage and air-gapped transaction signing workflows to prevent private key exposure.  

## Implementation Overview  
Users configure trading strategies through an intuitive YAML-based profile system that specifies target profit margins, maximum slippage tolerance, and chain-specific parameters. The system automatically manages nonce sequencing and gas price bidding wars through an RBF (Replace-By-Fee) optimizer. Advanced users can access raw mempool data streams for custom signal processing via Web3.py hooks.  

Deployment options include Docker containers for cloud orchestration, pre-built binaries for local execution, and a REST API for institutional trading infrastructure integration. The package incorporates continuous liquidity verification to abort trades if pool reserves change unfavorably post-transaction broadcast.  

## Operational Safeguards  
Built-in protection mechanisms analyze token contracts for hidden owner privileges, blacklist functions, and transfer tax inconsistencies. The system performs automated profit-taking through limit orders and stop-loss triggers based on either price thresholds or temporal conditions. A unique "sandbox mode" allows strategy backtesting against historical mempool datasets.  

## Getting Started  
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Node.js 18+ and Python 3.10+ with devtools installed  
2. **Configuration**: Customize network endpoints and wallet parameters in `.env`  
3. **Strategy Definition**: Create trading profiles in `strategies/` directory  
4. **Execution**: Launch main module with preferred logging verbosity level  

The system automatically generates encrypted local storage for sensitive credentials and maintains transaction audit logs in CSV format. For optimal performance, dedicated node connections from providers like QuickNode or Infura are recommended.  

## Ethical Considerations  
This tool is provided as experimental software for educational purposes only. Users assume full responsibility for complying with local regulations and exchange terms of service. The development team recommends implementing manual confirmation steps for high-value transactions and maintaining strict wallet segregation between bot operations and primary asset storage.  

## Contribution Guidelines  
The project welcomes enhancements to its exchange adapters, detection heuristics, and performance optimization techniques. All pull requests must include corresponding test cases in the `tests/` directory and documentation updates. A bounty program exists for verified improvements to the honeypot detection module.  

## Roadmap Features  
Planned developments include NFT minting event support, cross-chain arbitrage capabilities, and a decentralized front-running resistance system using commit-reveal schemes. The team is actively researching zero-knowledge proof implementations for transaction privacy preservation.
